# TITLE OF THE PROBLEM : 

Place exactly N bishops on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two bishops attack each other diagonally. Print one valid board configuration using 1s and 0s.

#  HOW IT WORKS : 

1. A 2D list (board) is created with all 0s.

2. Bishops (1s) are placed in different rows and non-attacking diagonal positions.

3. The algorithm uses a simple rule to avoid diagonal attacks by skipping columns.

4. It prints one valid board configuration.


# OUTPUT/RESULT :

# Note : 
This is a simple version, so it may not work for all N values (especially large ones), but it shows the basic idea of avoiding bishop attacks.
