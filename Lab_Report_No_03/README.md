#Problem : Given an undirected graph with N vertices and M edges. My task is to implement a Python program that uses Backtracking to determine whether the graph can be colored using K colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The input will be read from a file, where the first line contains three integers: N (number of vertices, numbered from 0 to Nâˆ’1), M (number of edges), and K (number of available colors). Each of the following M lines contains two integers u and v, representing an undirected edge between vertex u and vertex v.
